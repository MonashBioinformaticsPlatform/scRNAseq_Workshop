# Cluster Markers {#clustermarkers}

#### Why do we need to do this?  {- .rational}

Single cell data helps to segragate cell types. Use markers to identify cell types. warning: In this example the cell types/markers are well known and making this step easy, but in reality this step needs the experts curation.

## Finding differentially expressed features (cluster biomarkers)

Seurat can help you find markers that define clusters via differential expression. By default, it identifies positive and negative markers of a single cluster (specified in `ident.1`), compared to all other cells.  `FindAllMarkers()` automates this process for all clusters, but you can also test groups of clusters vs. each other, or against all cells.

The `min.pct` argument requires a feature to be detected at a minimum percentage in either of the two groups of cells, and the thresh.test argument requires a feature to be differentially expressed (on average) by some amount between the two groups. You can set both of these to 0, but with a dramatic increase in time - since this will test a large number of features that are unlikely to be highly discriminatory. As another option to speed up these computations, `max.cells.per.ident` can be set. This will downsample each identity class to have no more cells than whatever this is set to. While there is generally going to be a loss in power, the speed increases can be significant and the most highly differentially expressed features will likely still rise to the top.

```{r markers1, fig.height=8, fig.width=15}
# find all markers of cluster 2
cluster2.markers <- FindMarkers(pbmc, ident.1 = 2, min.pct = 0.25)
head(cluster2.markers, n = 5)
# find all markers distinguishing cluster 5 from clusters 0 and 3
cluster5.markers <- FindMarkers(pbmc, ident.1 = 5, ident.2 = c(0, 3), min.pct = 0.25)
head(cluster5.markers, n = 5)
# find markers for every cluster compared to all remaining cells, report only the positive ones
pbmc.markers <- FindAllMarkers(pbmc, only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25)
pbmc.markers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% slice_max(n = 2, order_by = avg_log2FC)
```

Seurat has several tests for differential expression which can be set with the test.use parameter (see our [DE vignette](de_vignette.html) for details). For example, the ROC test returns the 'classification power' `abs(AUC-0.5)*2` for any individual marker, ranging from 0 = random to 1 = perfect.

```{r markersroc, fig.height=8, fig.width=15}
cluster0.markers <- FindMarkers(pbmc, ident.1 = 0, logfc.threshold = 0.25, test.use = "roc", only.pos = TRUE)
```

We include several tools for visualizing marker expression. `VlnPlot()` (shows expression probability distributions across clusters), and `FeaturePlot()` (visualizes feature expression on a tSNE or PCA plot) are our most commonly used visualizations. We also suggest exploring `RidgePlot()`, `CellScatter()`, and `DotPlot()` as additional methods to view your dataset.

```{r}
VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "CD79A"))
# you can plot raw counts as well
VlnPlot(pbmc, features = c("NKG7", "PF4"), slot = 'counts', log = TRUE)
```

```{r markerplots}
FeaturePlot(pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "GNLY", "CD3E", "CD14", "FCER1A"))
FeaturePlot(pbmc, features = c("FCGR3A", "LYZ", "PPBP", "CD8A"))
```

<details>
  <summary>**Other useful plots**</summary>
These are ridgeplots, cell scatter plots and dotplots. Replace `FeaturePlot` with the other functions.

```{r ridgeplots}
RidgePlot(pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "GNLY", "CD3E", "CD14", "FCER1A"))
RidgePlot(pbmc, features = c("FCGR3A", "LYZ", "PPBP", "CD8A"))
```
For CellScatter plots, will need the cell id of the cells you want to look at. You can get this from the cell metadata (`pbmc@meta.data`).
```{r}
head( pbmc@meta.data )
CellScatter(pbmc, cell1 = "AAACATACAACCAC-1", cell2 = "AAACATTGAGCTAC-1")
```

DotPlots

```{r}
DotPlot(pbmc, features = c("MS4A1", "GNLY", "CD3E", "CD14", "FCER1A", "FCGR3A", "LYZ", "PPBP", "CD8A"))
```

`DoHeatmap()` generates an expression heatmap for given cells and features. In this case, we are plotting the top 10 markers (or all markers if less than 10) for each cluster.

```{r clusterHeatmap, fig.height=8, fig.width=15}
top10 <- pbmc.markers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(n = 10, wt = avg_log2FC)
DoHeatmap(pbmc, features = top10$gene) + NoLegend()
```


## Use makers to label or find a cluster


If you know markers for your cell types, use AddModuleScore to label them.

```{r}
genes_markers <- list(Naive_CD4_T = c("IL7R", "CCR7"))

pbmc <- AddModuleScore(object = pbmc, features = genes_markers, ctrl = 5, name = "Naive_CD4_T",
    search = TRUE)


# notice the name of the cluster has a 1 at the end
names(pbmc@meta.data)

# label that cell type
pbmc$cell_label = NA
pbmc$cell_label[pbmc$Naive_CD4_T1 > 1] = "Naive_CD4_T"
Idents(pbmc) = pbmc$cell_label

# plot
# Using a custom colour scale 
FeaturePlot(pbmc, features = "Naive_CD4_T1", label = TRUE, repel = TRUE, ) + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = c("lightblue","beige","red"))
```



## Assigning cell type identity to clusters

Fortunately in the case of this dataset, we can use canonical markers to easily match the unbiased clustering to known cell types:

Cluster ID | Markers       | Cell Type
-----------|---------------|----------
0          | IL7R, CCR7    | Naive CD4+ T 
1          | CD14, LYZ     | CD14+ Mono
2          | IL7R, S100A4  | Memory CD4+ 
3          | MS4A1         | B 
4          | CD8A          | CD8+ T 
5          | FCGR3A, MS4A7 | FCGR3A+ Mono
6          | GNLY, NKG7    | NK 
7          | FCER1A, CST3  | DC
8          | PPBP          | Platelet


```{r labelplot}
Idents(pbmc) <- pbmc$RNA_snn_res.0.5
new.cluster.ids <- c("Naive CD4 T", "CD14+ Mono", "Memory CD4 T", "B", "CD8 T", "FCGR3A+ Mono", "NK", "DC", "Platelet")
names(new.cluster.ids) <- levels(pbmc)
pbmc <- RenameIdents(pbmc, new.cluster.ids)
DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = 'umap', label = TRUE, pt.size = 0.5) + NoLegend()
```

```{r save.img, include=FALSE}
plot <- DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE, label.size = 4.5) + xlab("UMAP 1") + ylab("UMAP 2") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 18), legend.text = element_text(size = 18)) + 
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 10)))
ggsave(filename = "pbmc3k_umap.jpg", height = 7, width = 12, plot = plot, quality = 50)
```

```{r save.rds, eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(pbmc, file = "pbmc3k_final.rds")
```
