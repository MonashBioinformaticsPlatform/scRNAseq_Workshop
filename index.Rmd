# Getting started

Instructors:  [Paul Harrison](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics/about/people) & [Laura Perlaza-Jimenez](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics/about/people)

## Summary

This workshop, conducted by the Monash Genomics and Bioinformatics Platform, will cover how to extend analysis to contemporary third-party tools, [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/), [Harmony](https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony) and [SingleR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleR.html). We will be walking through the Single Cell analysis using Seurat package, correction of batch effects with Harmony and cell annotation using SingleR.  

If you are using virtual machine (VM) provided by the workshop, you don't need to install any R packages. **Skip SET UP** section.

If you are using your own computer, follow [Installation and Setup instructions](set-up.html).
