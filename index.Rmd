# Getting started

Instructors: [Adele Barugahare,](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics/about/people) [Paul Harrison](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics/about/people) & [Laura Perlaza-Jimenez](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics/about/people)

## Summary

This workshop, conducted by the Monash Genomics and Bioinformatics Platform, will cover how to extend analysis to contemporary third-party tools, Seurat and SingleR. We will be walking through the Seurat 3K PBMC Dataset Tutorial and extend this to cell annotation using SingleR.   
Material for scRNAseq analysis in R with Seurat workshop.This workshop follows the introductory [Guided Clustering Tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html) tutorial from Seurat.
